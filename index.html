<h2>About Me</h2>
Currently I am a second-year Ph.D. student of <a href=“http://cs.nju.edu.cn”> Department of Computer Science and Technology</a> and a member of <a href="http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx">LAMDA Group</a>, led by professor <a href="http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/">Zhi-Hua Zhou</a>.
Before my Ph.D. career, I was an undergraduate student of Kuang Yaming Honors School (recommend enrollment without requiring college entrance examination), Nanjing University and received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology on June, 2018.
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree at Nanjing University. Besides my research interests, I also have a great interest in finance, mainly about quantitative trading and risk management. At present, I am minored in Finance and have become a <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org">CFA</a> level Ⅰ candidate since September, 2019.

</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>My research interests lie in <b>realizing the decision-making intelligence</b> in practical challenges. A key approach is to apply (deep) reinforcement learning in real-world problems. During the past few years, I worked on several interesting topics including derivative-free optimization, dynamic environment reconstruction by generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) and tabular data synthesis with privacy guarantees by GANs. In the next few years, I would like to tackle challenges in making RL methods stronger and more applicable to real-world problems, for example integrating RL with casual inference, which is called <b>Causal RL</b>, and reconstructing a robust and dynamic environment for reinforcement learning, which can be considered to be a <b> model-based RL method.</b> </p>

<p>The idea of integrating RL with casual inference (Causal RL) is very attracting. The goal of the RL agent is to maximize the expected accumulated reward, indicating that RL itself does not have the ability to conduct causal inference. Therefore, causal inference can assist RL in learning value functions or policies more efficiently and effectively through inferring causal relations between states or between states and actions, such as reducing the state or action space and handling confounders. It is evident that causality and RL are complementary and can be integrated from the causal perspective to enhance both.</p>

<p>Directly applying RL in the real environment will cause unbearable cost. Our group's previous studies have discovered that it is feasible to build virtual environments with good generalizability solely from the historical data. These environments enable zero-cost trial-error training for industrial applications. </p>
